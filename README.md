# My notes on real analysis
The best way to learn something is to teach, so they say. I find that particularly valuable. I enjoy studying and teaching, and I also try to make notes and organize my studies. More importantly, I try to make it clear and hope to write it on an easy to grasp fashion.

## About this project
Real analysis is something I have been studying on my own for some time now. Partially because it is useful for other topics I am interested in, such as measure theory, probability and math in general. And partially because as a professional data scientist I often miss the theoretical explorations of math.

Here, I try to organize my studies, notes and thoughts on the topic of Real analysis. The material is organized as a book, and written in .tex.

## Outline of this project
Here is the list of topics I plan to organize on chapters:
- [ ] The real numbers
- [ ] Sequences and series
- [ ] Differentiation
- [ ] Integration
- [ ] Advanced topics
